templatemaker to-do list
========================

templatemaker.c
===============

* Is there a more efficient algorithm for the longest_match() C function?

* Provide a Python fallback module.

templatemaker.py
================

* Allow for user definition of symbols that would be treated as "single"
  units, instead of always using each character as a separate symbol for
  comparison.

* Create template, then load all known documents into it to get statistics
  on which holes differ more frequently. Can't do this while loading
  documents because a template's holes are not yet defined.

* Keep track of which holes have only 2 to 5 possible values, and mark those
  in a special way -- "option holes."

* Keep track of hole values in known documents, and mark certain holes as
  "pointless" if their values are duplicates.

* Don't save \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.

* Automatically determine which fields are dates/times, and have extract()
  convert to datetime objects.

* If learn() creates more holes, it should provide the PREVIOUS value for
  that hole (before it was a hole) for all previous documents. Thus,
  previous documents will be able to account for the new hole with the
  correct value. For example:

      >>> t = Template()
      >>> t.learn('<b>this and that</b><br>')
      >>> t.as_text('!')
      '<b>this and that</b><br>'

      >>> t.learn('<b>alex and sue</b><br>')
      True
      >>> t.as_text('!')
      '<b>! and !</b><br>'

      >>> t.last_change
      {0: 'this', 1: 'that'}

      >>> t.learn('<b>michael and scottie</b>')
      True
      >>> t.as_text('!')
      '<b>! and !</b>!'
      >>> t.last_change
      {2: '<br>'}

      >>> t.learn('<b>foo & bar</b><br>')
      True
      >>> t.as_text('!')
      '<b>! ! !</b>!'
      >>> t.last_change
      {1: 'and'}

 last_change is an attribute rather than being a return value of learn() to
 keep things clean. The value of last_change is overridden each time learn() is
 called.
